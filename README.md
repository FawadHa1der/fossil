### SETUP

1. Make sure you're running a venv with python 3.7.12
   To create such a virtualenv first make sure to have `pyenv` installed.
   Then run the following commands:

- `pyenv install 3.7.12`
- `pyenv local 3.7.12`
- `virtualenv venv --python=$(which python3<x86>)`
- `source venv/bin/activate`

NOTE: If you're using apple M1 please make sure you installed python3.7 with brew arch x86 using rosetta.
